            European-Jewish folklore has tales, that mock the foolish inhabitants of the city of Chelm.
            Among them, describes the wisest leaders of their community,
            trying to capture moonlight in a barrel, that is reflected off of the water contained inside
            of it, to save it for particularlly dark nights. 
            (אור הירח, moonlight, translated and grammaticly conjugated in hebrew, in the adjacent picture)
          </h1>
          <h1 id="chelm2">
            The story continues to give lessons, beyond the time of its origin. People continue to capture, preserve,
            and re-observe the light lost to history, through film, digital mediums, and emerging technoligies,
            of modern times. These efforts are gradual advancements, from the attempts of the Chelmites.
          </h1>
          <h1 id="chelm3">
            Continuing with the moonlight analogy, the light that reflects off the surface of water,
            is not only disstorted by the water, it reveals a 
            single point's perspective of the light source. 
            Consequently, the perception of the light depends on the position of both the barrel, and the observer.

    The next phase of development, was too collect and calcuate, the data, and display it accordingly.
