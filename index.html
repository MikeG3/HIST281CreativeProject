          <h1 id="chelm1" style="width: 95%; text-align: center;">
            European-Jewish folklore has tales about the foolish inhabitants of the city of Chelm.
            One story describes the wisest leaders of their community, 
            attempting to capture moonlight in a barrel, that is reflected off of the water contained inside
            of it, in order to save it for the future. 
          </h1>
          <h1 id="chelm2">
            The story continues to give lessons, beyond the time of its origin. People continue to capture, preserve,
            and re-observe the light lost to history, through film, digital mediums, and emerging technologies,
            of modern times. These efforts are gradual advancements, from the attempts of the Chelmites.
          </h1>
          <h1 id="chelm3">
            Continuing with the moonlight analogy, the light that reflects off the surface of water,
            is not only distorted by the water, it reveals a 
            single point's perspective of the light source. 
            Consequently, the perception of the light depends on the position of both the barrel, and the observer.

    For demonstrative purposes, I will provide software that I created, but abandoned as of August 2020, to provide a similar
    statistical web-service, seen below the authentic Health Canada Map
    <br> <br>
    The first phase of the software development process, starting
    the user-interface, to interact with the map.
    It currently displays the name of the provinces and their population.
    <br> <br> 
    The next phase of development, was too collect and calculate data, and display it accordingly.
    Because the project was abandoned, the data that the software provides visually, is obviously different than the 
    official data provided by Health Canada. All of the categories for each province, has its initial value of zero.

    The images, software and videos collected online, were carefully selected, 
    as not to violate intellectual property regulations, academic regulations, 
    nor the consent of artists, performers or content creators. 
    The project itself is a demonstration of how these concerns are subject to evolving interpretations.
    <br>
    The images at the top were taken from the course Moodle page, and Wikipedia.
    They have been interpreted and converted into numerical data.
    The images were animated using web-programming languages; HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
    The other animations, including the black and purple bars, and the flashing Warning text in the 
    "Online Covid Statistics" section, were animated using the same tools.
    <br> <br>
    Aa a final undergraduate endeavor, I would like to thank and dedicate this website to the incredible
    students and faculty, that have enriched my life so much in my academic experience. 
    Especially the professors that have dedicated their careers to the pursuit of knowledge. 
    After more than a decade, I have continually had the 
    great fortune of meeting such people that have never failed to impress and inspire me.
